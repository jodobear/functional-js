# Functional JS

Learning functional programming using JS from the the book by Michael Fogus

## Book Conventions

- Assign variables only once.
- Do not use eval.
- Do not modify core objects like Array and Function.
- Favor fn over methods.
- A defined fn at the start, should work in subsequent stages.
- Fn of zero parameters are used to denote that the arguments donâ€™t matter.
- In some examples, ... is used to denote that the surrounding code segments are being ignored.
- Text like inst#method denotes a reference to an instance method.
- Text like Object.method denotes a reference to a type method.
- Restricted if/else statements to a single line per branch, so avoided curly brackets, saves precious vertical space.
- I like to use semicolons.
- Italic: Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.
- Constant width(Mono) - program listings, and within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or fn names, databases, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.
- Constant width(Mono) bold - commands or text to be typed.
- Constant width(Mono) italic - replaced with values by user or determined by context.
